# AOI To Flightplans

Scripts for generating an optimised group of flight plans from an AOI:
- Given an AOI.
- Use the existing Drone TM
  [waypoint flight generation API](https://waypoint.naxa.com.np/api/waypoint).
- Subdivide the AOI and generate an optimised group of flight plans.
- Plans should have optimal overlap etc.
